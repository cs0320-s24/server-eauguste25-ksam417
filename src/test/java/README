Server
This Server project has a command line interface that, once the program is run, displays a line
linking to the localhost which is started at a specific port and allows the user to access different
endpoints: loadcsv, viewcsv, searchcsv, and broadband which all have different features and
functions.

Features:
The Server and CSV packages each have their own respective packages where the functionalities are
implemented.

These are as follows:
Aside from Testing, the packages are split into four main groups: CSV, Exceptions, Interfaces and
Server

-  Exceptions
  - There are two Exception files inside the Exceptions package: DatasourceException and
    FactoryFailureException to help handle any errors that we come across in the program

- Interfaces
  - There are two Interfaces inside the main Interfaces package: ACSDataSource and CreatorFromRow.
    CreatorFromRow is there to help with the Parser and Search implementation and ACSDataSource is
    there to assist with any broadband and ACS Data handling.

- CSV
  - The CSV package is split into two main parts: one package named 'Parser' which contains all the
    classes related to parsing a CSV file and the rest of the Classes are related to Searching and
    handling the CSVDataSources.

- Server
